### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
Yes it was

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If i had more time, i would made my website look more presentable by designing it more 

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
The API request feature went well, the display of the posters went well, the search feature was implemented well too. I noticed that my peer added the stretch feature that allows for the popup. I would've liked to do that too

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
Shout out the phenomenal Diogo and Thomas for helping explain the core concepts that i needed to finish and a special shoutout to Tim for helping me debug the final piece of the project in time.
